    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jay-ar</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Kimi No Nawa</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite anime movie. The story progresses differently compared to a typical romance movie but that's exactly what made it unique I guess.</p>

    <h3>Miracle in cell no.7</h3>
    <p>This is literally an eye-bawling movie. Everything about this movie is great and well-portrayed at the same time it somewhat illustrates part of reality of a judicial system.</p>

    <h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
    <p>Really cool and awesome mystery movie series.</p>
